- **Language:** Use **C++, Java, Python, or any language** of your choice.

## ðŸ“… Daily Topics (Examples)
1. Arrays (Basics, Traversal, Insertion, Deletion)
2. Strings (Manipulation, Substrings, Palindrome)
3. Searching (Linear & Binary Search)
4. Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Merge Sort)
5. Recursion (Base Case, Backtracking)
6. Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
7. Stack & Queue (LIFO, FIFO, Deque)
8. Hashing, Trees, Graphs, DP, Greedy, etc.
9. Advanced Topics (Tries, Segment Tree, Union-Find)
